# OSSD Blog Navigator
Team 6 Firefox Add-on: Make it easier to click through student weekly blogs.

## Description
This add-on allows you to navigate between weekly blogs and weekly blog repos for this course within the same tab by manipulating the url of the page.

## Features
- Search for a username or select from list of student usernames
- Toggle between a blog site and the github repo for the site
- Cycle through student blogs with carousel clicks or left/right arrow keys
- Navigate to blogs from the previous two semesters if you're extra nosy 

## Installation

To try the add-on in Firefox:
 
1. Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` in the search bar.
3. Click Load Temporary Add-onâ€¦
4. Select any file in the top level of the repo (usually manifest.json).
5. Now the extension is installed, but the popup will simply show an error message if you are not on a Hunter OSSD blog site or blog repo.
5. Go to a Hunter OSSD blog site or repository (example: [boubascript-weekly](https://hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020.github.io/boubascript-weekly/))and click on the icon in the menu to open the popup.
